## üíª Contributing
To contribute to the project, either create an issue or fork the repo and then follow the commit standard and make a PR. Or join the discord to talk about the feature you want to add or the issue you've encountered.

### Commit convention
When commiting to the repo its important to write commit messages that follow our convention, we even have a pre-commit hook that wont let you commit if you dont follow the convention.

Since we manage versions with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) we use prefixes to handle the semantic versioning when a build is triggered.

Here is an example taken from semantic-release's README.
| Commit message | Release type |
|---|---|
| fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied  | Patch Release |
| feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option	  | Minor Feature Release |
| perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option  | Major Release |
| BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release |

You can also use other prefixes that will trigger a build but not an official release.
These commands can be:
- 'chore'
- 'docs'
- 'revert'
- 'style'  
and many more.

Since we dont really want to publish this bot to NPM we use the plugin [@semantic-release/git](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)

You can read more about commit message conventions over at commitlint:  
[@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)
